Title: Meaning of Christmas

December 25 - what's the significance?
36 – Forces of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han, reuniting China
1492 – The explorer ship Santa María, commanded by Christopher Columbus, runs onto a reef off Haiti due to an improper watch.
1642 – Isaac Newton, Lincolnshire, England
1971 – Justin Trudeau, 23rd Prime Minister of Canada
1991 – Mikhail Gorbachev resigns as President of the Soviet Union (the union itself is dissolved the next day).

Missing - mention of birth of JC

Why?

We don't have documents pinning the date of his birth to 12/25. Somehow that date was ascribed to the nativity.

Lets take a pause

Instead of answering what is the meaning of the date. Let’s ponder what is the meaning of the person. What words and attributes come to mind when we think of Jesus?
eg. humility, savior, messiah, son of god, teacher, healer

So, I'd like to shift gears and tell a story

During college, I had a big brother of sorts. A friend that was a year ahead of me, I knew him from high school and we happened to be in the same major. I would get many of my text books from him, he’d tell me what classes were hard, lecturers to avoid, and he'd give me a ride back home to Cupertino.

What he also did was give me social support. Introduced his friends to me and invited me to ski trips with them

One year we had gone to Sierra at Tahoe. We stayed at a rental house about 30 mins away and our driver a guy named Jason was sidelined from too much activity due to injury and dropped us off there for the day while he hung out at the house

It was a decent day out there. Fairly clear but some light snow towards the latter part of the day. As usual, I fell a lot and with various creative landings. But it was fun!

Around 4pm were the last lifts for the day and the resort was closing down. We called our friend and waited in the lodge cafeteria for him to come pick us up.  30 mins passed, then an hour, then more and he hadn’t arrived.

The main cafe was now closed and we were directed to wait in the hallway near the entrance and restroom.

Finally we hear back from Jason, the snowfall had closed down part of the road and he was stuck waiting for a clearing.

Oh.

I imagine the others in the group were feeling similar discomfort but I in particular had snow that had snuck past various parts of my parka and pants—and by now it was melted. Every time someone went through the entrance a refreshing chilly breeze would come through and remind me of this.

Staff from the resort started to walk past us on their way to the restrooms. They were full from food and drink and full of spirit. Clearly something festive was happening

A couple of them went by. Presumably noticing the misery tracing our faces: wet. hungry. Tired.

One staffer walked past us then turned around. “Hey we’re having our Christmas party in the cafeteria. There’s plenty of food. Come join!”

And we did.

It was good to have some food. To get away from the element exposed door. But mostly to have been invited with kindness.

So this was a personal experience of Christmas. One I recollect from about 17 years ago

Going back to December 25th

While we may not get very good confirmation of tomorrow being the date of Jesus’ birth. It may well altogether not be. We instead can take tomorrow as a reminder of those traits which abound this season. The attributes of grace, humility, and kindness. And perhaps through that, align the meaning of Christmas with what it’s supposed to be.

Lets pray.
