## Local Cross-Cultural Ministry of Chinese Congregations in the San Francisco Bay Area
### Difference between OBC (overseas born Chinese) and ABC
1. *Individual vs group*: west - autonomy vs cohesiveness of family/clan
2. *Theory vs relationship* - western problem solution is to study to find best way to solve vs finding a solution without offending
3. *Differences vs equality*: looks at Pastor as friend vs as leader.. shows respect
4. *Love vs respect* - shown outwardly with hug/kiss vs rules and regulation.. respect ~= love
5. *Self-confidence vs humility* - outwardly talk about strength/accomplishments vs hide accomplishments and emphasize weaknesses.. detrimental to success in western corporate world
6. *Organism vs organization* - accustomed to organizational structure vs uncomfortable.. elaborating.. oriented to mystical/natural or pragmatic/social (left brain/cognitive vs right brain/aesthetic)
7. *Leadership* - credential vs service record
8. Chinese laypeople recognize pastor from tenure of service rather than degree/ordination
9. *Spiritual gifts vs secular crews* - Chinese value secular (age, speak Chinese, family background, degrees, marriage, children, house, leadership qualification, middle class status) vs academic training and professional experience
10. *Lubrication and preservation* - eg importance of wedding ceremony as a communal affair.. pastor represents God’s blessing upon families.. rituals as value affirmations
11. *Conflict management* -  confrontation vs consolidation.. in American culture direct confrontation is normal and expected.. for Chinese this is face-losing and can tear down communities.. preference to deal through indirect conflation

### Contemporary Issues in Diaspora Missiology
#### Chinese culture and relational paradigm
* encourage to postpone as long as possible any decision regarding future course of action.. when pressed will usually be with high degree of tentativeness .. best to keeps ones options open in the case situation changes

### The Dimensions of Culture [Beginners Guide to Crossing Cultures, Patty Lane]
1. Context
	1. High - stresses upon details such as physical env, body language, facial expression, tone of voice, appearance, how things are done.. most Asian countries
	2. Low - content is more important than context.. communication emphasis.. more likely US
2. Activity
	1. Doing - value results and materialism
	2. Being - value relationships and quality of life
3. Authority
	1. Egalitarian/informal - all persona have equal value and rights but society may still not treat all individuals equally leading to social strife
	2. Hierarchical/formal - tied to “uncertainty avoidance” not comfortable with ambiguous situations.. more rigid/dogmatic.. power distance.. how people feel about unequal distribution of power
4. Relationship
	1. collective - people seen as part of a group.. family, tribe, community
	2. individualistic - relate 1 on 1 basis (also associated with low context cultures)
5. Time
	1. Limited/evolving - emphasis on punctual and effective use of time
	2. Abundant/historical
6. Worldview
	1. Premodern - truth is subjective, knowledge more mystical (capricious), perspective holistic, evidence experiential (group then individual)
	2. modern - trust objective, knowledge scientific, perspective dualistic, linear, evident empirical
	3. postmodern - trust subjective (experience), knowledge is mystical (understandable), perspective holistic, evidence experimental (individual then group)
7. Honor and shame - keys for relationships
	1. Give gifts - reciprocity
	2. Know rules - know place in hierarchy 
	3. Don’t expose - avoid shaming
	4. Be clean - purity rules
	5. Guest well - lots of thank you

### The Chinese Culture from Other’s Perspective
* fundamental values: collectivism, large power distance, intragroup harmony
* seniority important.. no age-neutral words for brother/sister
* Younger people deferential to older

* Cross cultural meets with other parts

#### Challenges of Chinese church local cross-cultural ministries
* Youth minister confessed feelings of being used due to English skills.. treated as coworker, ministry leader, hired hand.. repented and expressed desire to be spiritual daughter of spiritual parents. Led to turn around of youth ministry
