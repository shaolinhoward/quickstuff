# Notes on being responsible with adult money

## Why?
Just jotting down stuff to share with friends and strangers alike to hopefully increase financial literacy and to wrangle some assorted factoids together. Feel free to comment and share!

## First job
The usual advice to start banking in order to take advantage of compounding interest. More likely than not, your earning power will grow from here so locking away a good part of the paycheck will be somewhat painful. Fear not as this will be worth it and your future self will thank you
Todo
- 401K vs Roth
- company matches
